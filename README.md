# My efforts on combining Ketcher and PyScript in different frontends

This repo contains examples on me combining Ketcher and PyScript in different frontends. The most basic one
is actually not here, but on by [blog page](https://churnikov.github.io/demo/pyketch/index.html). I wrote about it 
in [this blog post](https://churnikov.github.io/blog/pyscript-demo-with-molecules/).

But here are approaches that are present in this repo:

- [Slides with reveal.md](slides/). Gave a presentation with these slides at [EuroScipy 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiX0zlCFS-I)
- [Ketcher, PyScript and Django](django/)
- [Ketcher, PyScript and Panel](django/pyketch-panel.html)
- [Ketcher, PyScript and Dash](dash/). Doesn't really work. You'd better look at [Streamlit Ketcher](https://github.com/mik-laj/streamlit-ketcher)
